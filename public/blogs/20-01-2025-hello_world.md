## Hello World, Welcome to My Blog!

Hi there! üëã

So, Ive finally decided complete *hopefully* the last piece of my website, the blog. I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now, but I've always found excuses to put it off. But no more! I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences with you all.

### What‚Äôs on the website?  
Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what you‚Äôll find around here:  

- [**Projects:**](/#/projects) A collection of the cool (and occasionally chaotic) things I‚Äôve worked on ‚Äì from automating DevOps tasks to some fun coding experiments.  
- [**CV:**](/#/CV) A sneak peek at my professional journey ‚Äì think Python, TypeScript, Docker, and more. Oh, and I‚Äôve been dabbling in Go recently too!  
- [**Blog:**](/#/blog) Posts like this one, where I‚Äôll talk about my stack, stuff I‚Äôm working on, or anything else that‚Äôs caught my attention. Topics? Expect everything from software engineering to homelabbing ‚Äì maybe even some nerdy detours.  

### A bit about me  

```python
class Ruben:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Ruben Lopes"
        self.education = "Computer Science"
        self.interests = ["Software Engineering", "DevOps", "Homelabbing"]
        self.languages = ["Python", "TypeScript", "Go"]
        self.tools = ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "Terraform"]
```  

Basically, I‚Äôm a final-year Computer Science student who loves building things, solving problems, and playing around with tech.  

Feel free to check out my [projects](/#/projects) or grab a copy of my [CV](/#/CV) if you‚Äôre curious about what I‚Äôve been up to. And if you want to chat, don‚Äôt be shy ‚Äì reach out anytime!  

Catch you in the next post,  
Ruben ‚úåÔ∏è
